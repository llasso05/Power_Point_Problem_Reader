# Power_Point_Problem_Reader

This repository was created to extract problems from ppt text and images into an excel spreadsheet.

I created this project to support myself on an stats class, practice problems are provided on a power point containing the problem statement and a picture of the dataset.

Although this is a kind off uncommon, this situation opens the window for a bunch of different errors and some practices are graded, so this project is intended to avoid typing errors and to increase speed when solving these practices.

Thank you for reading!
